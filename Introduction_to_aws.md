# Introduction to AWS

**#What is cloud**

1.By using the concept of virtualization you can create a virtual machine in any part of the world and you can share it with others.

2.For example if your organization is in India and you requested 5 virtual machines for deploying your applications. 
Then devops engineers will create virtual machines and share ip addresses with you.

3.And you don't know where exactly these servers are but you'll continue to use servers.

4.That's why this concept is called as "Cloud" as you don't know where actually those resources are but you are still using it.

5.And because you are doing this entirely within your organization this concept is called as Private Cloud.

**#Public vs Private Cloud:**

1.Anybody in the world who has account with Aws,Azure irrespective of organization they can create the instances.
That's why it's called Public Cloud.

2.So the difference between public and private cloud is in private cloud it's you and your organization which managing & maintaining this entire cloud platform.

3.Whereas in public cloud the cloud providers like amazon/microsoft/google which are managing entire data center or ecosystem and you can request the resources from the providers.

**#Why public cloud is so popular?**

1.The main concern of people move to cloud because they want to get rid of entire maintenance overhead.

2.Also using public cloud one can reduce the overall cost of the organization i.e. cost optimization.
